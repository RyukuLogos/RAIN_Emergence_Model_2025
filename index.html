                <h2 class="chapter-title">Prologue: Why Does Music Touch the Soul?</h2>
                <p>We weep to music, rejoice in it, and sometimes resonate with others more deeply than words allow. Why does "rhythm"—neither language nor logic—move the human heart across cultural, linguistic, and generational boundaries?</p>
                
                <p>Music touches our hearts because <strong>rhythm lies at the root of meaning</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>In other words, meaning arises from "closed waves" generated within temporal repetition, and this paper hypothesizes that even qualia (qualitative experience) and fragments of consciousness originate from rhythmic structure.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight">
                    <p><strong>The purpose of this theory is to develop and verify the following propositions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rhythmic closure generates meaning</li>
                        <li>Waves that fail to close create "space"</li>
                        <li>Brain cognition, cosmic structure, and even AI design follow this rhythmic principle</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="research-note">
                    <p><strong>Background research and conceptual connections:</strong><br>
                    The influence of rhythm on emotion and meaning has been noted in neuroscience. It is widely demonstrated that music strongly activates the limbic system and precedes meaning formation (Levitin, 2006). The correspondence between brain waves and conscious states (EEG α waves, γ waves, etc.) also aligns with the hypothesis that "meaning is rhythmic structure."</p>

                <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: Everything Began from Chaos</h2>
                <p>Once, the universe had neither "space" nor "meaning." There existed only countless waves (vibrations)—a pure chaotic temporal domain without period or order.</p>
                
                <p>In this primordial state, all waves interfered with each other, dispersing without periodicity. There was no "closure" or "structure," and therefore no meaning could emerge.</p>
                
                <p>However, within this ocean-like wave field, a kind of miracle occurred.</p>
                
                <p><strong>That miracle was attunement.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Multiple waves occasionally overlapped with the same period, creating "stable closed structures through mutual interference."</p>
                
                <p>This was the first "meaning" and the birth of "rhythmic existence."</p>

                        <li>Through interference and resonance, closed waveforms are formed (= structures with periodicity)</li>
                        <li>At this point, "Rhythm ID" is defined as "existence distinguishable from others"</li>
                        <li>The first "one-dimensional structure (circular)" emerges in this way</li>

                <p>Rhythm is not merely temporal repetition. For rhythm to have "meaning," it must be a closed structure (periodicity).</p>
                
                <div class="formula">
                    Closed Wave = Periodicity = Meaning

                <p>All meaning is found within "endless repetition."</p>
                
                <p>A closed wave is a structure where the waveform returns to itself, remaining in a predictable state for the next moment. This means entropy reduction—the creation of order.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight">
                    <p><strong>Rhythm ID and Structural Definition:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Waves that cannot close have no meaning</li>
                        <li>Closed waveforms are formed through interference and resonance (= structures with periodicity)</li>
                        <li>Closed waves possess a "Rhythm ID" distinguishable from other waves</li>
                        <li>Rhythm ID is a signature defined by specific combinations of period, phase, and amplitude</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <p>Conversely, waves that cannot close—namely, irrational frequencies and non-integer ratio interference—dissipate energy externally and are not retained as structure.</p>
                
                <p>Therefore, they are not perceived as "meaning" and continue to disperse like background noise. The history of these "waves that failed to become meaning" relates to the emergence of "space" discussed in later chapters.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mathematical reinforcement and consistency:</strong><br>
                    In Fourier transform, closed waves (integer multiple frequencies) appear as sharp peaks in the spectrum. This is the physical basis of Rhythm ID (Bracewell, 2000). In psychology and neuroscience, it's known that the brain recognizes meaningful sounds (music and language) based on "periodicity" (Buzsáki, 2006).</p>

                <p>This chapter begins with the question: Where do "unclosed waves" go?</p>
                
                <p>The conclusion stated first: they create a new phase field called "space."</p>

                <p>Irrational frequency waves—those with ratios like π or √2—can never completely close. They lack periodicity and constantly "drift."</p>
                
                <p>This drift creates interference, and as it accumulates, a "container to receive the drift = space" becomes necessary.</p>
